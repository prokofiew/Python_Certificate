MODULE 4 - Lists

 3.6.1 The inner life of lists

Now we want to show you one important, and very surprising, feature of lists, which strongly distinguishes them from ordinary variables.

We want you to memorize it ‒ it may affect your future programs, and cause severe problems if forgotten or overlooked.

list_1 = [1]
list_2 = list_1
list_1[0] = 2
print(list_2)

Console:
[2]

The program:

   - creates a one-element list named list_1;
   - assigns it to a new list named list_2;
   - changes the only element of list_1;
   - prints out list_2.

The surprising part is the fact that the program will output: [2], not [1], which seems to be the obvious solution.

Lists (and many other complex Python entities) are stored in different ways than ordinary (scalar) variables.

You could say that:

   - the name of an ordinary variable is the name of its content;
   - the name of a list is the name of a memory location where the list is stored.

Read these two lines once more ‒ the difference is essential for understanding what we are going to talk about next.

The assignment: list_2 = list_1 copies the name of the array, not its contents. In effect, the two names (list_1 and list_2) identify the same location in the computer memory. Modifying one of them affects the other, and vice versa.

How to cope with that?:
Fortunately, the solution is at your fingertips ‒ it's called a slice.

A slice is an element of Python syntax that allows you to make a brand new copy of a list, or parts of a list.

It actually copies the list's contents, not the list's name.

This is exactly what you need. Take a look at the snippet below:

list_1 = [1]
list_2 = list_1[:]
list_1[0] = 2
print(list_2)
 
Console:
Its output is [1].

This inconspicuous part of the code described as [:] is able to produce a brand new list.


One of the most general forms of the slice looks as follows:

my_list[start:end]

As you can see, it resembles indexing, but the colon inside makes a big difference.

A slice of this form makes a new (target) list, taking elements from the source list ‒ the elements of the indices from start to end - 1.

Note: not to end but to end - 1. An element with an index equal to end is the first element which does not take part in the slicing.

Using negative values for both start and end is possible (just like in indexing).


===============================
MODULE 4 - IN and NOT operators
===============================

ython offers two very powerful operators, able to look through the list in order to check whether a specific value is stored inside the list or not.

These operators are:

elem in my_list
elem not in my_list
 

The first of them (in) checks if a given element (its left argument) is currently stored somewhere inside the list (the right argument) ‒ the operator returns True in this case.

The second (not in) checks if a given element (its left argument) is absent in a list ‒ the operator returns True in this case.

my_list = [0, 3, 12, 8, 2]

print(5 in my_list)
print(5 not in my_list)
print(12 in my_list)



===============================
MODULE 4 - SUMMARY 3.6.7
===============================

1. If you have a list list_1, then the following assignment: list_2 = list_1 does not make a copy of the list_1 list, but makes the variables list_1 and list_2 point to one and the same list in memory. For example:

vehicles_one = ['car', 'bicycle', 'motor']
print(vehicles_one) # outputs: ['car', 'bicycle', 'motor']
 
vehicles_two = vehicles_one
del vehicles_one[0] # deletes 'car'
print(vehicles_two) # outputs: ['bicycle', 'motor']
 

2. If you want to copy a list or part of the list, you can do it by performing slicing:

colors = ['red', 'green', 'orange']
 
copy_whole_colors = colors[:]  # copy the entire list
copy_part_colors = colors[0:2]  # copy part of the list
 

3. You can use negative indices to perform slices, too. For example:

sample_list = ["A", "B", "C", "D", "E"]
new_list = sample_list[2:-1]
print(new_list)  # outputs: ['C', 'D']
 

4. The start and end parameters are optional when performing a slice: list[start:end], e.g.:

my_list = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
slice_one = my_list[2: ]
slice_two = my_list[ :2]
slice_three = my_list[-2: ]
 
print(slice_one)  # outputs: [3, 4, 5]
print(slice_two)  # outputs: [1, 2]
print(slice_three)  # outputs: [4, 5]
 

5. You can delete slices using the del instruction:

my_list = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
del my_list[0:2]
print(my_list)  # outputs: [3, 4, 5]
 
del my_list[:]
print(my_list)  # deletes the list content, outputs: []
 

6. You can test if some items exist in a list or not using the keywords in and not in, e.g.:

my_list = ["A", "B", 1, 2]
 
print("A" in my_list)  # outputs: True
print("C" not in my_list)  # outputs: True
print(2 not in my_list)  # outputs: False

MODULE 4 Lists in lists 3.7.1
================================

Lists can consist of scalars (namely numbers) and elements of a much more complex structure (you've already seen such examples as strings, booleans, or even other lists in the previous Section Summary lessons). Let's have a closer look at the case where a list's elements are just lists.

We often find such arrays in our lives. Probably the best example of this is a chessboard.

A chessboard is composed of rows and columns. There are eight rows and eight columns. Each column is marked with the letters A through H. Each line is marked with a number from one to eight.

The location of each field is identified by letter-digit pairs. Thus, we know that the bottom left corner of the board (the one with the white rook) is A1, while the opposite corner is H8.

Let's assume that we're able to use the selected numbers to represent any chess piece. We can also assume that every row on the chessboard is a list.

Look at the code below:

row = []
 
for i in range(8):
    row.append(WHITE_PAWN)


======================================
MODULE 4 Two-dimensional arrays 3.7.2 
======================================

Let's also assume that a predefined symbol named EMPTY designates an empty field on the chessboard.

So, if we want to create a list of lists representing the whole chessboard, it may be done in the following way:

board = []
 
for i in range(8):
    row = [EMPTY for i in range(8)]
    board.append(row)
 

Note:

   - the inner part of the loop creates a row consisting of eight elements (each of them equal to EMPTY) and appends it to the board list;
   - the outer part repeats it eight times;
   - in total, the board list consists of 64 elements (all equal to EMPTY-)

This model perfectly mimics the real chessboard, which is in fact an eight-element list of elements, all being single rows. Let's summarize our observations:

   - the elements of the rows are fields, eight of them per row;
   - the elements of the chessboard are rows, eight of them per chessboard.

The board variable is now a two-dimensional array. It's also called, by analogy to algebraic terms, a matrix.

As list comprehensions can be nested, we can shorten the board creation in the following way:

board = [[EMPTY for i in range(8)] for j in range(8)]
 

The inner part creates a row, and the outer part builds a list of rows.

Access to the selected field of the board requires two indices ‒ the first selects the row; the second ‒ the field number inside the row, which is de facto a column number.

Take a look at the chessboard. Every field contains a pair of indices which should be given to access the field's contents:

 

It builds a list containing eight elements representing the second row of the chessboard ‒ the one filled with pawns (assume that WHITE_PAWN is a predefined symbol representing a white pawn).
List comprehensions

The same effect may be achieved by means of a list comprehension, the special syntax used by Python in order to fill massive lists.

A list comprehension is actually a list, but created on-the-fly during program execution, and is not described statically.

Take a look at the snippet:

row = [WHITE_PAWN for i in range(8)]
 

The part of the code placed inside the brackets specifies:

    the data to be used to fill the list (WHITE_PAWN)
    the clause specifying how many times the data occurs inside the list (for i in range(8))

Take a look at some other list comprehension examples:

Example #1:

squares = [x ** 2 for x in range(10)]
 

The snippet produces a ten-element list filled with squares of ten integer numbers starting from zero (0, 1, 4, 9, 16, 25, 36, 49, 64, 81)

Example #2:

twos = [2 ** i for i in range(8)]
 

The snippet creates an eight-element array containing the first eight powers of two (1, 2, 4, 8, 16, 32, 64, 128)

Example #3:

odds = [x for x in squares if x % 2 != 0 ]
 

The snippet makes a list with only the odd elements of the squares list.
